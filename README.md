# 3D RISK

A web-based 3D-globe take on the board game RISK.

## Monorepo layout

```
packages/engine    Pure, deterministic TypeScript rules engine (shared by client, server, AI)
apps/client        Vite + React + React-Three-Fiber front end (the 3D globe)
```

Future packages (see the build order below): `apps/server` (Colyseus authoritative
multiplayer), and an AI module inside `packages/engine`.

## Getting started

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev          # starts the client on http://localhost:5173
```

Rotate the globe by dragging. Hover a country to see its name; click to cycle it
through player-ownership colours (a placeholder to prove per-country selection and
recolouring works).

## The game board asset

`apps/client/public/transparent_country_globe_gameboard.glb` is a glTF 2.0 binary
containing **177 country meshes**, each a named node (Natural Earth country names)
under a single `world` root. No materials are baked in — the client assigns colours
per country at runtime.

## Deployment

The client is a static SPA hosted on the Hetzner VPS behind Caddy, served at
**`3drisk.iainwilson.uk`**. Pushing to `main` runs `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`,
which typechecks, tests, builds `apps/client`, and rsyncs `apps/client/dist/` to
`/srv/3drisk/` on the VPS.

One-time setup (owner-only, needs the Smokingskull / Cloudflare / VPS accounts):

1. **Create the repo** — empty public `Smokingskull/3d-risk` on GitHub, then push
   (remote already set to the `github.com-smokingskull` SSH alias).
2. **Repo secrets** (Settings → Secrets → Actions), same as `iainwilson.uk`:
   `VPS_HOST=167.233.119.140`, `VPS_USER=iain`, `VPS_SSH_KEY=<deploy private key>`.
3. **DNS** — Cloudflare A record `3drisk` → `167.233.119.140` (DNS-only / grey cloud).
4. **Caddy** — append `deploy/3drisk.Caddyfile` to `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile` on the VPS,
   then `sudo systemctl reload caddy` (Let's Encrypt issues the cert automatically).

After that, every push to `main` redeploys.

## Build order (roadmap)

1. **Engine** — RISK rules as a pure deterministic module + tests. _(done: types, RNG,
   board data, and the reinforce/attack/fortify state-machine with cards — 32 tests)_
2. **Globe client** — load GLB, colour/highlight countries by name, local hotseat. _(done:
   World/Classic modes, colour-by-owner, army labels, phase-driven clicks + HUD)_

### Rules engine

`applyAction(state, action)` is a pure, deterministic reducer (all randomness comes
from the state's seed + cursor), so the client, server, and AI run identical code
and always agree. Key exports from `@risk3d/engine`: `createGame`, `applyAction`,
`validateAction` / `isLegal`, `listLegalActions`, plus selectors
(`reinforcementsFor`, `ownsContinent`, `pathExists`, …). Turn flow is
reinforce → attack (⇄ occupy) → fortify, with full RISK cards (escalating set
bonuses, award-on-conquest, forced trade at 5+, steal-on-elimination). Run tests
with `pnpm --filter @risk3d/engine test`.

### Board data

`packages/engine/src/data/` holds the board. Land adjacency is **derived from the
mesh geometry** (adjacent Natural Earth countries share exact border vertices) by
`scripts/build-board.mjs`, then merged with hand-authored continents
(`world.continents.json`) and sea routes (`world.searoutes.json`). Regenerate with:

```bash
pnpm --filter @risk3d/engine build:board
```

The generated board JSON is validated at build time and should not be hand-edited —
edit the source data and rerun. Two board modes ship:

- **World** — all 177 countries, 6 continents, land adjacency from geometry + curated
  sea routes. Build: `build:board`.
- **Classic** — 42 major countries mapped to the classic 6 continents at classic
  sizes/bonuses, with **hand-curated** adjacency (`classic.adjacency.json`) that
  reproduces the original board's choke points. Build: `build:classic`.

Rebuild both with `pnpm --filter @risk3d/engine build:boards`. Load either via
`getBoard("world" | "classic")` from `@risk3d/engine`.
3. **AI** — heuristic → MCTS in a Web Worker; single-player vs CPU. _(done: easy/medium/hard
   deterministic policies + exact combat odds, run in a Web Worker; MCTS + adaptive
   opponent-modelling still to come)_
4. **Server** — Colyseus authoritative multiplayer; mixed local + remote sessions.

### AI

`packages/engine/src/ai/` holds the CPU brains: `battleOdds.ts` (exact
`conquestProbability` from dice recursion — the AI reasons about odds, never peeks
at the RNG), `evaluate.ts` (position scoring), and `policy.ts` (`createAI(difficulty)`
+ `planTurn(state)`). All deterministic, so CPU turns are reproducible and tested,
including full CPU-vs-CPU games that terminate with a winner. In the client the AI
runs in `apps/client/src/game/ai.worker.ts` off the main thread; seats are chosen in
the start menu (Human / Easy / Medium / Hard, any mix).
5. **Persistence** — accounts, resumable games, move-log archive.
6. **Learning** — per-opponent modelling, then optional self-play RL.
